  const texts = ["“Trading doesn’t just reveal your character; it also builds it if you stay in the game long enough.” - Yvan Byeajee", "“Confidence is not ‘I will profit on this trade.’ Confidence is ‘I will be fine if I don’t profit from this trade.” - Yvan Byeajee", "“Trading is very competitive and you have to be able to handle getting your butt kicked.” - Paul Tudor Jones", "“Hope is [a] bogus emotion that only costs you money.” -Jim Cramer", "“Never, ever argue with your trading system” - Michael Covel ",

  "“The goal of a successful trader is to make the best trades. Money is secondary.” - Alexander Elder","“If most traders would learn to sit on their hands 50 percent of the time, they would make a lot more money.” - Bill Lipschutz","“There is a time to go long, a time to go short and a time to go fishing.” - Jesse Livermore","“I just wait until there is money lying in the corner, and all I have to do is go over there and pick it up. I do nothing in the meantime.” - Jim Rogers","“I believe in analysis and not forecasting.” - Nicolas Darvas",
  "“Short-term volatility is greatest at turning points and diminishes as a trend becomes established.” - George Soros","“The core problem, however, is the need to fit markets into a style of trading rather than finding ways to trade that fit with market behaviour.” - Brett Steenbarger","“I always laugh at people who say, ‘I’ve never met a rich technician.’ I love that!

They are taking 5 to 10 percent risk, on a trade they should be taking 1 to 2 percent risk on.” - Bruce Kovner","“Are you willing to lose money on a trade? If not, then don't take it. You can only win if you're not afraid to lose.

Loeb",
  "“The key to trading success is emotional discipline.

You’re never going to be right nine times out of ten.” - Peter Lynch","“Every trader has strengths and weaknesses. Some are good holders of winners but may hold their losers a little too long. Others may cut their winners a little short but are quick to take their losses. As long as you stick to your own style, you get the good and bad in your own approach.” - Michael Marcus",

Keep a trading diary – write down your reasons for entering and exiting every trade. Look for repetitive patterns of success and failure.” - Alexander Elder","“A lot of people get so enmeshed in the markets that they lose their perspective. Working longer does not necessarily equate with working smarter. In fact, sometimes is the other way around.” - Martin Schwartz",
  "“A peak performance trader is totally committed to being the best and doing whatever it takes to be the best. He feels totally responsible for whatever happens and thus can learn from mistakes.

Investing is not a game where the guy with the 160 IQ beats the guy with 130 IQ.” - Warren Buffet","“We simply attempt to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful.” - Warren Buffet",
